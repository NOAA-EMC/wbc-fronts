# Introduction
This repository is forked from NOAA EMC Ocean Verification branch frontal analysis written by Todd Spindler.
The purpose of this repository is to show comparison of observational analyses of three Western Boundary Currents:
the Gulf Stream, Loop CUrrent and Kurushio Current obtained from Naval Oceanographic Office for the Gulf Streamand the Naval Eastern Ocean Center for the Loop CUrrent and Kuroshio Current with the appropriate frontl location computed from the Global RTOFS model, overlaid on maps of the Global RTOFS Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Height, and Surface Currents.
